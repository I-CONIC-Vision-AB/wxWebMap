This folder holds a makefile for building the test app wxWebMapApp. This makefile should be replaced by an updated CMakeLists in the examples folder.

Run the following command to build:

$ make -f makefile.unx

Also, make sure the library is built and placed in the build/ folder first. See README.md in the root folder for instructions
